# hangman-CLI

This is a hangman game created in node using three seperate files, a game controller, a word handler, and a letter handler.  The latter two are exported modules.  This app also uses the prompt and require node packages.

To play the game, when prompted select "cars" or "countries"  those are the only two options at present.  
The game will give you an option to play again whether you win or loose.
